# codemacs

A [spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs) configuration **following my personal taste** coming from [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) and other modern editors.

Corrections and additions are welcome, simply file a ~merge~ pull request.

#### TODO:
- Apply keybindings over the `emacs` and `evil` defaults (see commented lines in `STARTUP` section of `dotspacemacs/user-config`)


### Disclaimer

As a newcomer to the emacs environment and lisp, customizations may be unefficient or even incorrect.
